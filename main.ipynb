    "\n",
    "#### Models to consider\n",
    "- Polynomial Regression using Basis Expansion (Scikit-learn mostly)\n",
    "- Fully connected Neural Network (Probably PyTorch)\n",
    "- Investigate how to use ChatGPT or something\n",
    "- Support Vector Regression (Scikit-learn SVR)\n",
    "- Ensemble Method: Random Forest Regressor (Also scikit-learn probably)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Considerations:\n",
    "- For each model, there are most likely hyperparameters that can be tuned.\n",
    "- E.g. polynomial regression can use L2 or L1 (or both) regularization to avoid overfitting, this has a parameter that can be tuned\n",
    "- Haven't looked into the others but probably just ask ChatGPT\n",
    "- Can use k-fold cross validation to validate hyper-parameters (or just use validation test set, k-fold would be more robust though)\n",
    "- Trial and error to find a decent starting point then search in the parameter space around it using for loops (GridSearch I guess)\n",
    "- HOPE IT WORKS!"
